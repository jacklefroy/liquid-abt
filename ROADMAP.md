## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Integration Pattern
All integrations follow the **Adapter Pattern** with common interfaces:

```typescript
interface PaymentProcessor {
  connect(tenantId: string): Promise<OAuthResult>;
  handleWebhook(payload: any, signature: string): Promise<WebhookResult>;
  getTransactions(tenantId: string, from: Date, to: Date): Promise<Transaction[]>;
  healthCheck(): Promise<boolean>;
}
```

### Feature Flags
Centralized feature management allows safe incremental deployment:

```typescript
export const features = {
  stripe: true,     // Phase 1 ‚úÖ
  square: false,    // Phase 2
  xero: false,      // Phase 3
  zerocap: false,   // Phase 5 (pending API)
};
```

### API Versioning
All APIs are versioned from the start:
- `/api/v1/webhook/stripe` (Active)
- `/api/v1/webhook/square` (Ready for Phase 2)
- `/api/v1/integrations/status` (Integration management)

### Database Strategy
Multi-tenant architecture with schema isolation:
- Master database for tenant management
- Individual schemas per tenant (`tenant_uuid`)
- Cross-tenant security validation

| Phase | Customers | Monthly Volume | Integrations | Uptime |

| 1 | 5+ | $10K+ AUD | 1 Payment | 99.5% |
| 2 | 25+ | $100K+ AUD | 3 Payment | 99.7% |
| 3 | 100+ | $500K+ AUD | 3 Payment + Compliance | 99.8% |
| 4 | 500+ | $1M+ AUD | Full Ecosystem | 99.9% |
| 5 | 1,000+ | $10M+ AUD | Institutional Grade | 99.95% |

## üîß Development Guidelines

### Adding New Integrations

1. **Create Interface Implementation**
   ```typescript
   export class NewIntegration implements PaymentProcessor {
     // Implement all required methods
   }
   ```

2. **Add Feature Flag**
   ```typescript
   new_integration: {
     enabled: false,
     phase: X,
     expectedDate: 'Month Year'
   }
   ```

3. **Register with Factory**
   ```typescript
   this.register('new_integration', new NewIntegration());
   ```

4. **Create Webhook Endpoint**
   ```
   /src/app/api/v1/webhook/new_integration/route.ts
   ```

5. **Add to Integration Config**
   ```typescript
   new_integration: {
     enabled: false,
     requiredEnvVars: ['NEW_API_KEY'],
     comingSoon: 'Phase X'
   }
   ```

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 80%+ coverage for critical modules
- **Integration Tests**: All payment processors and Bitcoin exchanges
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user workflows
- **Security Tests**: SQL injection, XSS, CSRF protection

### Deployment Strategy
- **Staging Environment**: Test all integrations before production
- **Feature Flags**: Safe rollout of new features
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime releases
- **Database Migrations**: Versioned schema changes
